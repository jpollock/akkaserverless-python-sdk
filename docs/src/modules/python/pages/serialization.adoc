include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::partial$serialization.adoc[]

As a Python developer, JSON is likely more familiar to you. When creating Event Sourced Entities, you can configure serialization for primitives or for Json, using `serializeAllowPrimitives` or `serializeFallbacktoJson`, respectively.

== Setting the serialization flag


The following example sets JSON serialization fo a snapshot:

[source,python,indent=0]
----
const EventSourcedEntity = require("@lightbend/akkaserverless-python-sdk").EventSourcedEntity;


const entity = new EventSourcedEntity(
  ["shoppingcart.proto", "domain.proto"],
  "com.example.shoppingcart.ShoppingCart",
  {
    persistenceId: "shopping-cart",
    snapshotEvery: 5, // Usually you wouldn't snapshot this frequently, but this helps to demonstrate snapshotting
    includeDirs: ["./"],
    serializeFallbackToJson: true // Enables JSON support for persistence
  }
);
